1. How to use bower for something that is not already in the bower repositories?
This works:

~~~~~~~
bower -s install flipclock=git@github.com:objectivehtml/FlipClock.git
~~~~~~~

But there is a lot of stuff, so 

~~~~~~~
scp -r bower_components payne68106@mattpayne.org:mattpayne.org/tt
~~~~~~~
takes a long time.
